## Environment Variable Validation

Create-T3-App uses [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for environment variable validation at runtime _and_ buildtime by providing additional files (scaffolded with generic environment variables for the chosen libraries):

üìÅ src/env

‚î£ üìÑ server.mjs

‚î£ üìÑ client.mjs

‚î£ üìÑ schema.mjs
<br></br>

A `z.object` is used as a schema, with each object key representing an environment variable and value representing a `z` method for validation. Each time a new environment variable is needed, it must be added to _both_ .env[.local/.production etc] as well as `schema.mjs`.

# Files

## schema.mjs

This is the file that contains the Zod schemas, and by default, contains two exported schemas, `serverSchema` and `clientSchema`, as well as a `clientEnv` object.

### Server Schema

Specify your server-side environment variables schema here.

```typescript
// src/env/schema.mjs

export const serverSchema = z.object({
  // FOO: z.string(),
});
```

### Client Schema

Specify your client-side environment variables schema here.
To expose them to the client, prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

```typescript
// src/env/schema.mjs

export const clientSchema = z.object({
  // NEXT_PUBLIC_BAR: z.string(),
});
```

### clientEnv Object

You can't destruct `process.env` as a regular object, so you have to do
it manually here. This is because Next.js evaluates this at build time,
and only used environment variables are included in the build.

```typescript
// src/env/schema.mjs

export const clientEnv = {
  // NEXT_PUBLIC_BAR: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BAR,
};
```

## server.mjs

This is the file that performs the validation on server-only environment variables (those which aren't prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`), using the `z.object` schema from `schema.mjs`. It is imported into `next.config.mjs` to use for buildtime validation. This file likely shouldn't be modified unless you know what you're doing.

## client.mjs

Similar to `server.mjs`, this file performs the validation on client-side environment variables (those which are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`).

## Add a new environment variable

To ensure your build never completes without the environment variables the project needs, you will need to add new environment variables in **two** locations:

`.env`

Added in the regular method of `NAME=VALUE`

`schema.mjs`

Added inside the `clientSchema` or `serverSchema` objects depending on if they are to be consumed client-side or in your backend, defining the type as a [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schema.

### Example

_I need to add a new environment variable to my project, with a name of `POKEAPI_KEY` and a value of `1234ABCD`._

`.env` file:

```bash
# .env

# ... any other variables that are already here
POKEAPI_KEY=1234ABCD
```

`schema.mjs` file:

```typescript
// src/env/schema.mjs

export const serverSchema = z.object({
  // ... any other variables that are already here
  POKEAPI_KEY: z.string(),
});
```

Now, schema validation will occur at runtime and build time to ensure the `POKEAPI_KEY` is present in my environment variables.

## Type-safe Environment Variables

To utilise the schema containing environment variables in your code editor, you should import `{ env }` from either `/env/server.mjs` or `/env/client.mjs` depending where they are being used. The `env` object is a type-safe parsed result of the relevant schema, allowing for auto-completion of environment variables in your code editor.
