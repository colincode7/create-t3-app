We recommend deploying your app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss). It makes it super easy to deploy Next.js apps.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss) and sign up with GitHub.
3. Create a Project and import the repository you pushed your code to.
4. Add your environment variables.
5. Click **Deploy**.
6. Now whenever you push a change to your repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy your website!
