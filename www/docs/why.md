## Why TypeScript ?

Javascript is hard. Why add more rules?

We firmly believe the experience TypeScript provides will help you be a better developer, regardless of where you are in your career as an engineer. Whether you're new to web development or a seasoned pro, the "strictness" of TypeScript will provide a less frustrating, more consistent experience than vanilla JS

## Why Next.js ?

We love React. It has made UI development accessible in ways we never imagined before. It also can lead developers down some rough paths.

Next.js offers a lightly opinionated, heavily optimized approach to creating a website using React. From routing to API definitions to image rendering, we trust Next.js to lead developers towards good decisions.

## Why tRPC/Prisma/Tailwind/etc?

While we believe in keeping things as simple as possible, we find these pieces being used in every "app" like project we build. create-t3-app does a great job of letting you adopt the pieces you need.
