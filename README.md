# What is this? Some kinda template?

Kind of. We love all of the technologies that create-t3-app includes, but we do NOT believe every project needs all of them.

We made `create-t3-app` to do **one thing** - simplify the complex boilerplate around the core T3 Stack tech without compromising the modularity of the pieces.

This is **NOT** an all-inclusive template. We don't add things that are as simple as an `npm install zustand`. _If you cut an issue asking us to add your preferred libraries, we will make fun of you._

## What is the T3 Stack?

The _"T3 Stack"_ is a web development stack made by [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg), focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **full-stack typesafety**.

It consists of

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

# T3 Axioms

I'll be frank - this is an _opinionated project_. We share a handful of core beliefs around building, and we treat them as the basis for our decisions.

## 1. Solve Problems

It's easy to fall in the trap of "adding everything" - we explicitly _don't_ want to do that. Everything added to `create-t3-app` should solve a _specific_ problem that exists within the core technologies included.

This means we **won't** add things like state libraries (zustand, redux), but we **will** add things like NextAuth.js and integrate it with Prisma and tRPC for you

## 2. Bleed Responsibly

We love our bleeding edge tech. The amount of speed and, honestly, _fun_ that comes out of new shit is really cool. We think it's important to **bleed responsibly**, using riskier tech in the less risky parts.

This means we **wouldn't** bet on risky new database tech (SQL is great!) - but we **happily** bet on tRPC (it's just functions, moving off it is trivial).

## 3. Typesafety Isn't Optional

Two of the three T's are typesafe (Typescript, tRPC). We take typesafety seriously in these parts. Any decision that compromises the full-stack typesafe nature of `create-t3-app` is a decision that should be made in a different project.
