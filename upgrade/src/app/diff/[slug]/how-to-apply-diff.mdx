## Patching

<Steps>

### Apply the diff

To apply the patch, you can use the following command:

`git apply --reject ./t3-upgrade.patch`

This will create a new file with the changes that could not be applied.

### Apply the changes manually

You can then use wiggle to apply the changes manually:

`wiggle -r ./package.json ./package.json.rej`

This will apply the changes to the file and create a file called
package.json.porig with the original file.

### Resolve conflicts

In case of conflicts, it will add the conflict markers to the file.
You can then resolve the conflicts manually.

</Steps>

Remember to place your patch file in the project directory, or use the correct file path.
